<h2>Open Research Resources:</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://osf.io/be7yt/">Australia/New Zealand Open Research Network project</a> on the Open Science Framework is an excellent place to go for resources relating to open research practices. You can find resources for <a href="https://osf.io/be7yt/wiki/Learning%20R/">Learning R</a> (an open source language for statistical computing), <a href="https://osf.io/be7yt/wiki/Podcasts/">podcasts</a> relating to open research, <a href="https://osf.io/be7yt/wiki/Powering%20your%20research/">statistical power calculators</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/be7yt/wiki/Reading%20lists/">reading lists</a>, and <a href="https://osf.io/be7yt/wiki/Teaching%20Open%20and%20Reproducible%20Practices/">syllabi</a> for teaching open and reproducible practices.</p>
<p>Another great set of resources is the <a href="https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/toolbox/index.html">Open Science Toolbox</a> hosted by the LMU Open Science Centre.</p>
<p>Closer to home, a group of Victoria University postgraduate students (Karl, Walsh, Robinson and Twitchin) have published an article entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333614749_Developing_the_credibility_of_psychological_science_Graduate_student_reflections_on_open_science">Developing the credibility of psychological science: Graduate student reflections on open science</a>. This article is an excellent read for students (and others!) seeking to engage with open science practices.</p>
