description: >
  The New Zealand Open Research Network (NZORN) is a collection of researchers and research-associated workers in New Zealand. It aims to facilitate the growth of Open practices by bringing together independently motivated and like-minded people, and providing a platform for the sharing of resources.

  NZORN is inspired by the <a href="https://openscience-utrecht.com/">Open Science Community Utrecht</a> and the <a href="https://morn.netlify.com//">Melbourne Open Research Network</a>. 
  We are one of a number of location-specific open sciences communities across Oceania that were initiated in October-November 2018.
